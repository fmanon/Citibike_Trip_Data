# City Bike Trip Data

Citi Bike first launched in New York City back in May of 2013 with 6,000 bikes total. Since then, it has grown to 12,000 bikes shared among 143,000 members (as of May 2018). Citi Bike's makes its data available for all. Given the availability of said data, we plan on doing the following:

- Build a SQL database populated with the data
- Build visualization tools that would help tell a story
- Build a time series model that would help with estimating future data

Each of the above will take place across separate notebooks.  The data used in this project will be that of Jersey City's Citibike trips.  From it, we plan on deriving insight into the Citibikes themselves, as well as its users.

This repo will be updated regularly until all above tasks are completed.
